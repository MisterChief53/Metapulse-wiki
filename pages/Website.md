- ## Container Setup Notes
	- Can we create a project as an empty folder with just a Dockerfile that has the environment defined, and then setup the nextjs project inside that dockerfile using the shell?
		- if we can do that, that means that we can run arbitrary commands inside the container from vscode, as if it was local development!
- ## Using the Dev Container
	- Install the `Dev Containers` extension for VSCode
	- Press F1 and choose `Open Folder in Container`
	- Choose the Website folder.
	- Now you have access to a terminal inside the docker folder!
