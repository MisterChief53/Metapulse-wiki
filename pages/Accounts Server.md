- ## Access The Accounts Server Development Environment
	- Open IntelliJ IDE on the Accounts Server folder.
	  id:: 65cf733c-dab5-4209-97c0-f77ef430c473
	- Configure a run configuration that uses the `docker-compose.yml` file.
	- Now, if you want to run it, just execute that run configuration and it will execute the code.
- ## Dependencies
	- Since we are building a docker container that will use spring and deal with PostgreSQL, we will probably use the following Spring Dependencies:
		- Spring Web
		- Spring Data JPA
		- Spring Security
		- PostgreSQL Driver
