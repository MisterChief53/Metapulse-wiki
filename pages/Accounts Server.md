- ## Access The Accounts Server Development Environment
	- Open IntelliJ IDE on the Accounts Server folder.
	  id:: 65cf733c-dab5-4209-97c0-f77ef430c473
	- Configure a run configuration that uses the `docker-compose.yml` file.
	- Now, if you want to run it, just execute that run configuration and it will execute the code.
- ## Dependencies
	- Since we are building a docker container that will use spring and deal with PostgreSQL, we will probably use the following Spring Dependencies:
		- Spring Web
		- Spring Data JPA
		- Spring Security
		- PostgreSQL Driver

	- Seeders
		- Currently, there exists only one seeder for the database:
			- DatabaseSeeder.
				- This seeder will delete all the previous content of the database, and will create two new users "edson" and "angel", both having the password "12345", as well as three items, Red, Green, and Blue.
				- For safety, all the content in the "run" method is commented, in order to prevent the unintended deletion of the database if you did any changes.
				- If you want to use this, you need to delete the comment and run the server, the seed will be automatically planted.
