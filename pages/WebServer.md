- ## Container Setup Notes
	- Can we create a project as an empty folder with just a Dockerfile that has the environment defined, and then setup the nextjs project inside that dockerfile using the shell?
		- if we can do that, that means that we can run arbitrary commands inside the container from vscode, as if it was local development!
- ## Using the Dev Container
	- Install the `Dev Containers` extension for VSCode
	- Press F1 and choose `Open Folder in Container`
	- Choose the Website folder.
	- After the container is initialized, git it a few minutes for it to pull the dependencies.
		- If the dependencies do not appear after a while, don't worry, you can install them as usual later, by running `npm install` in the folder.
	- Now you can create a new VSCode terminal, and it will be initialized inside the folder and the container!
- ## Deploying
	- Execute the `docker-compose.yml`, and after the website compiles, it will be on `localhost:8080`.
